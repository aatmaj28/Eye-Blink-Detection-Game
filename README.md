# Eye-Blink-Detection-Game
My Eye Blink Detection Game project starts by detecting your face, and if you blink, it displays a "you lose" message. Although a minor project, it holds the potential to be transformed and integrated with driver drowsiness software, contributing to enhanced safety measures. Explore the interactive and adaptable nature of eye blink detection technology in gaming and driver safety applications.
